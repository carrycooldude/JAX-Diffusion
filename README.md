## Features

- Implementation of diffusion models in **JAX**.
- High-performance and scalable computations.
- Modular and extensible codebase.
- Interactive Gradio app for easy experimentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/JAX-Diffusion.git
   cd JAX-Diffusion
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Train a diffusion model:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```

### Generate samples:
```bash
python generate.py --model checkpoints/model.pth
```

### Run the Gradio App:
```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch a Gradio interface where you can generate samples interactively.

## Gradio App Preview

| Input | Output |
